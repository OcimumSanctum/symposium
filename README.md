# symposium


For now, one file contains both an outline of the solid ideas I've heard about you all putting together so far and a "Minutes" section in which I logged what seem to be uncommitted ideas as yet. The latter can be used to ponder for next week what were still thoughts in progress. Please add, alter, and remove as you wish.
